# ORBITAL STATION SIGMA — A Social Deduction Scenario

## Setting

The year is 2187. Orbital Station Sigma is humanity's most ambitious deep-space research outpost, positioned at the L2 Lagrange point beyond the Moon. Home to a crew of elite scientists, engineers, and administrators, the station was designed to push the boundaries of quantum physics and artificial intelligence.

Three days ago, the station's quantum communication array — its only link to Earth — was deliberately sabotaged. Security footage was wiped. The backup shuttle's launch codes have been changed. Someone on this station does not want the crew to go home.

Intelligence reports intercepted before the blackout suggest that operatives from the Prometheus Collective — a rogue transhumanist faction — have infiltrated the crew. Their goal: seize control of the station's experimental quantum core, codenamed ATLAS, and use it to upload human consciousness into a distributed AI network. They believe this is the next step in human evolution. Earth Command considers it an existential threat.

The remaining loyal crew members must identify and neutralize the Prometheus operatives before they can activate ATLAS. But the operatives are brilliant, well-trained, and indistinguishable from the rest of the crew. Trust is the most dangerous commodity on Station Sigma.

## Factions

### United Earth Space Agency (UESA) — Alignment: Good
The legitimate crew members loyal to Earth Command. They were selected for this mission based on expertise and psychological resilience. Their goal is simple: identify the Prometheus infiltrators through debate and democratic vote in the station's emergency council sessions, and restore communication with Earth.

### The Prometheus Collective — Alignment: Evil
Ideological extremists who believe biological humanity is a dead end. They have spent years placing sleeper agents in key positions across UESA's deep-space program. On Station Sigma, their operatives work in secret to protect each other, eliminate threats during the station's "night cycle" power-downs, and buy enough time to activate ATLAS. They know each other's identities.

## Roles

### Commander (Faction: UESA)
The station's ranking officer. No special night ability, but carries significant moral authority in council discussions. Must rely on logic, observation, and leadership to guide the crew toward the truth.

### Science Officer (Faction: UESA, Ability: Investigation)
Has access to the station's biometric monitoring system. During each night cycle, can scan one crew member's neural activity patterns to determine their true faction allegiance. Must be careful about revealing findings — the Prometheus operatives will target anyone who gets too close to the truth.

### Medical Officer (Faction: UESA, Ability: Protection)
Controls the station's emergency cryogenic pods. Each night cycle, can place one crew member into protective stasis, rendering them immune to any hostile action. Cannot protect the same person two nights in a row.

### Chief Engineer (Faction: UESA)
Maintains the station's life support and power grid. A regular crew member without special night abilities, but possesses deep technical knowledge that can help identify inconsistencies in other crew members' stories about the sabotage.

### Prometheus Operative (Faction: Prometheus Collective, Ability: Elimination)
A deep-cover agent trained in psychological manipulation and covert operations. During each night cycle, the Prometheus operatives coordinate to select one crew member for "removal" — staging an accident, inducing a medical emergency, or simply ensuring they disappear during the power-down. They are masters of deception who can mimic any personality and deflect suspicion with ease.

### Prometheus Technician (Faction: Prometheus Collective, Ability: Elimination)
A technical specialist who infiltrated the engineering division. Works alongside other Prometheus operatives during night cycles to carry out eliminations. Their engineering expertise makes their cover story nearly airtight — they always have a plausible reason for being anywhere on the station.

## Win Conditions

- **UESA wins** if all Prometheus Collective operatives are identified and voted off the station (ejected via escape pod) through the emergency council process.
- **Prometheus Collective wins** if the number of Prometheus operatives equals or exceeds the number of loyal UESA crew members. At that point, they have enough control to activate ATLAS and there are not enough loyal crew to stop them.

## Game Phases

### Council Session (Discussion Phase — 5 minutes)
All surviving crew members gather in the station's central command module for an emergency council session. Anyone can speak, accuse, defend, or share information. The station's AI moderator tracks the discussion but cannot intervene.

### Emergency Vote (Voting Phase — 2 minutes)
The council votes on which crew member to eject from the station via escape pod. A simple majority decides. In case of a tie, no one is ejected — the Prometheus operatives survive another cycle.

### Identity Reveal (Reveal Phase — 1 minute)
After ejection, the ejected crew member's true identity and faction allegiance are revealed to all remaining crew through their personnel file. This information is critical — it confirms or denies suspicions and reshapes the political landscape of the station.

### Night Cycle (Night Phase — Power-down period)
The station enters its mandatory 8-hour power conservation cycle. Lights dim to emergency levels. The Prometheus operatives use this window to coordinate and eliminate a target. Simultaneously, the Science Officer conducts covert scans, and the Medical Officer can place someone in protective stasis.

## Atmosphere

The station hums with the low drone of recycled air. Emergency lighting casts long amber shadows down the curved corridors. Every viewport frames the infinite black of deep space — a constant reminder that there is nowhere to run. The crew sits around the hexagonal council table, their faces lit by the pale blue glow of holographic displays. Someone at this table has already killed. Someone at this table will kill again. And the only weapon the loyal crew has is their ability to see through the lies.
