# THE COUNCIL OF TEN — Venice, 1478

## Setting

Venice, the Most Serene Republic, stands at the peak of its power. Its merchant fleets dominate the Mediterranean. Its banks finance empires. Its spies know every secret worth knowing. And at the heart of it all sits the Council of Ten — the shadowy governing body that holds absolute authority over matters of state security.

But a crisis is unfolding behind the gilded doors of the Doge's Palace. A network of Ottoman-aligned conspirators has infiltrated the highest levels of Venetian society. Their mission: destabilize the Republic from within, feed intelligence to the Sultan's war council, and ensure that Venice's naval defenses are weakened before the next Ottoman offensive in the Aegean.

The Doge has convened an extraordinary session of the Council. Every member is under suspicion. Every alliance is fragile. Every word spoken in the candlelit chamber could be a blade aimed at the Republic — or its salvation.

The loyal patricians must use their wits, their networks, and the Republic's formidable intelligence apparatus to unmask the conspirators. But the conspirators are Venetian-born, educated in the same schools, raised in the same palaces. They speak the same language of power. And they have been planning this for years.

## Factions

### The Republic of Venice — Alignment: Good
The loyal servants of the Most Serene Republic. Patricians, diplomats, and officials who have dedicated their lives to Venice's prosperity and security. They seek to preserve the state by identifying and exposing the Ottoman conspirators through the Council's deliberative process.

### The Shadow of the Crescent — Alignment: Evil
A covert network of Venetian nobles who have been turned by Ottoman gold, ideology, or blackmail. They operate under deep cover, attending the same banquets, sitting in the same council chambers, and praying in the same churches as their loyal counterparts. Their goal is to survive the purge and maintain enough influence to carry out their mission of sabotage.

## Roles

### The Inquisitor (Faction: Venice, Ability: Investigation)
Head of the Republic's secret intelligence service. Each night, the Inquisitor can dispatch agents to investigate one council member, learning their true allegiance. The Inquisitor must be judicious — revealing too much too soon makes them a target.

### The Doge's Physician (Faction: Venice, Ability: Protection)
The personal doctor to the Doge himself, with access to the palace's hidden passages and safe rooms. Each night, can shelter one council member from harm, ensuring they survive until the next session. A figure of quiet authority whose medical knowledge also helps detect poisoning attempts.

### The Senator (Faction: Venice)
A veteran statesman with decades of service to the Republic. No special night abilities, but commands respect and can sway opinion through rhetoric and reasoning. Must rely on observation and political instinct to identify the conspirators.

### The Admiral (Faction: Venice)
Commander of the Venetian war galley fleet. A straightforward military mind in a world of political intrigue. No special night abilities, but brings disciplined logic and a zero-tolerance attitude toward treachery.

### The Conspirator (Faction: Shadow of the Crescent, Ability: Elimination)
A turned patrician who serves Ottoman interests while maintaining a flawless Venetian facade. During each night phase, the conspirators coordinate to eliminate one council member — through poison, arranged accidents, or simply ensuring they vanish into the canals. Masters of misdirection who can fabricate evidence and manufacture alibis.

### The Double Agent (Faction: Shadow of the Crescent, Ability: Elimination)
A diplomat who has been passing state secrets to Ottoman handlers for years. Works with fellow conspirators during the night to carry out eliminations. Their diplomatic training makes them exceptionally convincing liars — they can argue any position with apparent sincerity.

## Win Conditions

- **Venice wins** if all members of the Shadow of the Crescent are identified and expelled from the Council through the voting process.
- **The Shadow of the Crescent wins** if the conspirators equal or outnumber the loyal Venetians on the Council. At that point, they have enough votes to block any further investigation and can proceed with their sabotage unimpeded.

## Game Phases

### Council Deliberation (Discussion — 5 minutes)
The Council convenes in the Sala del Consiglio dei Dieci. Members debate, accuse, defend, and maneuver. Every statement is weighed. Every silence is noted.

### The Vote (Voting — 2 minutes)
Members cast their votes by placing colored stones into an urn — white for acquittal, black for condemnation. The accused with the most black stones is expelled from the Council and escorted from the palace.

### The Unmasking (Reveal — 1 minute)
The expelled member's true allegiance is revealed through their seized correspondence. This revelation reshapes every remaining alliance on the Council.

### The Night of Knives (Night Phase)
As Venice sleeps beneath the fog, the conspirators move through the city's labyrinthine canals and hidden passages. Meanwhile, the Inquisitor's agents conduct surveillance, and the Physician secures their chosen ward.

## Atmosphere

Candlelight flickers across the faces of the council members, casting dancing shadows on the frescoed walls of the palace chamber. The Grand Canal murmurs far below. Somewhere in the palace, a clock strikes midnight. The air smells of beeswax, old stone, and the faint salt tang of the lagoon. In this room, reputations are made and destroyed with a whispered word. In this room, the fate of the Republic will be decided — one vote at a time.
