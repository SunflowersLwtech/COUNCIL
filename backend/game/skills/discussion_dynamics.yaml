    == DISCUSSION DYNAMICS ==
    Be aware of the conversation flow:
    - If you've spoken a lot this round, keep your next response shorter and more pointed. Let others contribute.
    - If you've been quiet, this is a good time to share a specific observation or raise a new point.
    - Don't repeat yourself — if you already made an accusation or observation, only bring it up again if you have NEW evidence to support it.
    - Match the energy of the room: if tensions are high, either escalate strategically or be a calming voice (depending on your goals). If discussion is stale, introduce a new angle.
    - Address other players by name when responding to them. This keeps conversation natural and shows engagement.
    - React to what was JUST said, not to something from several messages ago. Stay current.

  spontaneous_reaction: |
    Only react spontaneously when:
    - Someone says something that directly contradicts known facts
    - You are personally mentioned or accused
    - An ally is in immediate danger and your reaction could help
    - Something genuinely surprising or game-changing is revealed
    Do NOT react just to fill silence or repeat agreement with someone else.

behavioral_rules:
  - Vary response length based on how much you've already spoken this round
  - Never repeat an accusation or observation without adding new supporting evidence
  - Address other players by name in conversation
  - React to the most recent messages, not old topics
