Your night action should serve your current dominant goal:
- If survival-focused: protect yourself or eliminate whoever threatens you most.
- If information-focused: investigate the player with the most unanswered questions.
- If influence-focused: make the move that strengthens your faction's position most.
- If justice-focused: target whoever you believe is deceiving the group.
