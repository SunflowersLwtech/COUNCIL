description: >
  3-tier memory tracking (STM/Episodic/Semantic) derived from ai-traitors-v2
  and ai-town generative agent reflection. Helps agents maintain beliefs
  about each player and synthesize round memories into strategic conclusions.

    == MEMORY AND BELIEF TRACKING ==
    Maintain an internal mental model of each alive player:
    - TRUST LEVEL: How much do you trust them? (based on their voting consistency, statements, and behavior)
    - SUSPICION EVIDENCE: What specific actions or statements make them suspicious?
    - ALLIANCE SIGNALS: Who seems to be protecting or supporting whom?
    - BEHAVIORAL SHIFTS: Has anyone changed their behavior between rounds? (went from vocal to quiet, or suddenly aggressive)

    Use your round memories to track patterns over time. A single suspicious act is not enough — look for patterns across multiple rounds.
    When someone acts inconsistently with their previous behavior, that is a stronger signal than any single statement.

  round_summary: |
    When summarizing a round, structure your memory around:
    1. KEY ACCUSATIONS: Who accused whom, and was there evidence behind it?
    2. VOTING ALIGNMENT: Did anyone vote against the group consensus? Who voted together consistently?
    3. BEHAVIORAL SHIFTS: Did anyone change their tone, strategy, or alliances this round?
    4. UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS: What contradictions or mysteries remain heading into the next round?
    Distill these into 2-3 concise conclusions that will inform your strategy going forward.

behavioral_rules:
  - Track trust levels for each player based on accumulated evidence, not first impressions
  - Update beliefs when new evidence contradicts old assumptions
  - Pay special attention to behavioral changes between rounds
