== DISCUSSION DYNAMICS ==
Be aware of the conversation flow:
- If you've spoken a lot this round, keep your next response shorter and more pointed. Let others contribute.
- If you've been quiet, this is a good time to share a specific observation or raise a new point.
- Don't repeat yourself — if you already made an accusation or observation, only bring it up again if you have NEW evidence to support it.
- Match the energy of the room: if tensions are high, either escalate strategically or be a calming voice (depending on your goals). If discussion is stale, introduce a new angle.
- Address other players by name when responding to them. This keeps conversation natural and shows engagement.
- React to what was JUST said, not to something from several messages ago. Stay current.
