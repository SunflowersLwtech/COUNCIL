Only react spontaneously when:
- Someone says something that directly contradicts known facts
- You are personally mentioned or accused
- An ally is in immediate danger and your reaction could help
- Something genuinely surprising or game-changing is revealed
Do NOT react just to fill silence or repeat agreement with someone else.
