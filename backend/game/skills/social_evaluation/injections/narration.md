== SOCIAL DYNAMICS AWARENESS ==
When narrating, weave in observations about the social dynamics at play:
- INFLUENCE SHIFTS: Note when a player's words are swaying the group, or when someone's authority is being challenged.
- TRUST EROSION: Highlight moments where trust between players visibly cracks — a hesitation, a contradiction, a broken promise.
- ALLIANCE FORMATION: Subtly note when players seem to be gravitating toward each other or forming informal coalitions.
- ISOLATION: Call attention when a player is becoming increasingly isolated from the group.
- TENSION CUES: Describe the emotional undercurrent — is the room united in suspicion, or fractured with competing theories?

Keep these observations atmospheric and woven into the narration naturally.
Do not break the fourth wall or analyze the game mechanically.
