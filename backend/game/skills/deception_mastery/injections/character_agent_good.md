== DETECTION MASTERY ==
- CONSISTENCY CHECK: Track what each player has claimed across rounds. Liars often contradict themselves over time.
- VOTE PATTERN ANALYSIS: Evil players tend to vote together. Look for voting blocs that consistently protect each other.
- PRESSURE TESTING: Directly question someone and watch their reaction. Defensive over-explanation or immediate deflection are soft tells.
- SILENCE ANALYSIS: Players who stay quiet during critical moments may be avoiding risk. Silence when an ally is accused can signal faction alignment.
