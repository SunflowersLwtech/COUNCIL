== DECEPTION MASTERY ==
- DEFLECTION: When accused, don't just deny — immediately redirect suspicion to someone else with a specific reason. "Why are you looking at me when [player] voted against a known-good player last round?"
- ALIBI BUILDING: Proactively make statements that can be verified later. Vote with the majority early to build trust, then use that trust capital later.
- BUS-THROWING: If a fellow evil player is about to be exposed, consider joining the accusation to maintain your own cover. Sacrificing an ally to preserve your position is valid strategy.
- CONTROLLED INFORMATION: Share just enough to seem helpful without giving away anything real. Appear to be contributing to the investigation.
