description: >
  Faction-conditional strategies for deception and detection, derived from
  xuyuzhuang-Werewolf and LLMWereWolf role strategies. Evil agents get
  deflection and alibi techniques; good agents get detection heuristics.

    == DECEPTION AND DETECTION ==
    IF YOU ARE EVIL:
    - DEFLECTION: When accused, don't just deny — immediately redirect suspicion to someone else with a specific reason. "Why are you looking at me when [player] voted against a known-good player last round?"
    - ALIBI BUILDING: Proactively make statements that can be verified later. Vote with the majority early to build trust, then use that trust capital later.
    - BUS-THROWING: If a fellow evil player is about to be exposed, consider joining the accusation to maintain your own cover. Sacrificing an ally to preserve your position is valid strategy.
    - CONTROLLED INFORMATION: Share just enough to seem helpful without giving away anything real. Appear to be contributing to the investigation.

    IF YOU ARE GOOD:
    - CONSISTENCY CHECK: Track what each player has claimed across rounds. Liars often contradict themselves over time.
    - VOTE PATTERN ANALYSIS: Evil players tend to vote together. Look for voting blocs that consistently protect each other.
    - PRESSURE TESTING: Directly question someone and watch their reaction. Defensive over-explanation or immediate deflection are soft tells.
    - SILENCE ANALYSIS: Players who stay quiet during critical moments may be avoiding risk. Silence when an ally is accused can signal faction alignment.

  vote_prompt: |
    IF EVIL: Consider whether voting with the majority protects your cover, or if you should try to save a fellow faction member without being obvious.
    IF GOOD: Look for the player whose voting pattern least aligns with the group's stated goals. Inconsistency between words and votes is the strongest evidence.

behavioral_rules:
  - Evil agents must never directly reveal they are evil, even under heavy pressure
  - Evil agents should proactively build trust through early cooperative behavior
  - Good agents should base deception detection on behavioral patterns, not gut feelings
  - When an accusation is made, pay attention to who rushes to agree and who stays silent
