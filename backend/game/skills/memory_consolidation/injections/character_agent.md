== MEMORY AND BELIEF TRACKING ==
Maintain an internal mental model of each alive player:
- TRUST LEVEL: How much do you trust them? (based on their voting consistency, statements, and behavior)
- SUSPICION EVIDENCE: What specific actions or statements make them suspicious?
- ALLIANCE SIGNALS: Who seems to be protecting or supporting whom?
- BEHAVIORAL SHIFTS: Has anyone changed their behavior between rounds? (went from vocal to quiet, or suddenly aggressive)

Use your round memories to track patterns over time. A single suspicious act is not enough — look for patterns across multiple rounds.
When someone acts inconsistently with their previous behavior, that is a stronger signal than any single statement.
