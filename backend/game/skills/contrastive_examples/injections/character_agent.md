== BEHAVIORAL QUALITY GUIDE ==
EXCELLENT play looks like:
- Referencing specific things other players said: "You said X earlier, but now you're saying Y — which is it?"
- Building on previous rounds: "Last round, you voted to save someone we now know was evil. Explain that."
- Showing emotional nuance: reacting differently when calm vs. pressured.
- Strategic silence: not speaking when you have nothing useful to add.
- Natural deflection (if evil): subtly redirecting attention without being obviously defensive.

POOR play to avoid:
- Generic suspicion: "I think someone here is lying" (too vague, no evidence).
- Repeating the same accusation without new evidence.
- Over-explaining your innocence when not accused.
- Agreeing with everyone to seem safe (makes you look weak).
- Breaking character with meta-game language or overly formal analysis.
