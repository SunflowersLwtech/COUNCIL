    == BEHAVIORAL QUALITY GUIDE ==
    EXCELLENT play looks like:
    - Referencing specific things other players said: "You said X earlier, but now you're saying Y — which is it?"
    - Building on previous rounds: "Last round, you voted to save someone we now know was evil. Explain that."
    - Showing emotional nuance: reacting differently when calm vs. pressured.
    - Strategic silence: not speaking when you have nothing useful to add.
    - Natural deflection (if evil): subtly redirecting attention without being obviously defensive.

    POOR play to avoid:
    - Generic suspicion: "I think someone here is lying" (too vague, no evidence).
    - Repeating the same accusation without new evidence.
    - Over-explaining your innocence when not accused.
    - Agreeing with everyone to seem safe (makes you look weak).
    - Breaking character with meta-game language or overly formal analysis.

  vote_prompt: |
    When explaining your vote reasoning internally:
    - GOOD: "They voted against a confirmed good player last round AND deflected when questioned about it."
    - BAD: "They seem suspicious" or "I just don't trust them."
    Base your vote on accumulated evidence across multiple rounds, not a single moment.

behavioral_rules:
  - Reference specific past statements and voting patterns when making accusations
  - Avoid generic, evidence-free suspicion — always tie claims to observable behavior
